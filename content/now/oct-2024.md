# Using Golang for LLM Apps



# What Not To Do

Uncle Bob put it like this [see full video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecIWPzGEbFc):

> If we have made any advances in software, since 1945, it is almost entirely in **what not to do**. Structured Programming was in what not to do — don’t use unrestrained GOTO. Functional Programming — don’t use assignment. Object-Oriented Programming — don’t use pointers to functions. What we have learned over the last 70-some years is more about what not to do, than what to do. There have been no radical advances in software technology. The craft of writing software remains roughly the same as it was in 1945 — a little more modern, but not essentially any different.


- Using frameworks. Tech stack complexity should always be less than application complexity. 99% of **current** LLM application complexity consists of two tasks: string substitution and calling HTTP endpoints. The keyword is current because the technology is young. Building abstraction this early is premature optimization. At work I advocates using only `text/template` (or `templ` for string substitution)+ `net/http` (or `requests` for calling HTTP endpoints) for RAG workflow.

- Using more than postgres and redis. Single point of truth is a pretty good mental model. At work I advocate buil
